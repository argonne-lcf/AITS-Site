Argonne AI-testbed System at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) provides an infrastructure of next-generation AI-accelerator machines. It aims to help evaluate usability and performance of machine learning based high-performance computing applications running on these accelerators. The goal is to better understand how to integrate with existing and upcoming supercomputers at the facility to accelerate science insights. 
 
Activities:
- Maintain a range of hardware and software environments for AI-accelerators

- Provide a platform to benchmark applications, programming models and ML frameworks

- Support science application teams to port and evaluate their applications

- Co-ordinate with vendors with product developments  
 
Currently, the AI-testbed has Cerebras, SambaNova and GraphCore systems set up and running. We are working closely with vendors including Groq, among others.
