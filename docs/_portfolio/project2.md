At the core of this system is a Reconfigurable Dataflow UnitTM (RDU) which is a next-generation processor that provides dataflow processing and acceleration. The software stack, SambaFlowTM, extracts, optimizes and maps dataflow graphs to RDUs from standard machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. SambaNova Systems DatascaleTM is a rack-level accelerated system that includes DataScale nodes with integrated networking. The system deployed at Argonne AI testbed is a half-rack RDA system consisting of two nodes, each with eight RDUs. The RDUs on a node are interconnected via a proprietary interconnect to enable both model parallelism as well as data parallelism. Each node consists two sockets with 128 cores and 1 TB of memory and are interconnected using an Infiniband-based fabric.
