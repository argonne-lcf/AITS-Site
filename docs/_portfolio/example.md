Processing, memory, and communication in CS-1 reside in the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a 462 square-cm silicon wafer with approximately 400,000 processor cores. Each core has 48 KB of dedicated SRAM memory (for a total of 18GB on-chip), and all cores are connected to one another over a high bandwidth, low latency, two-dimensional interconnect mesh. The software platform integrates popular machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch.
