        <p>Argonne AI-Testbed at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) provides an infrastructure of next-generation AI-accelerator machines. It aims to help evaluate usability and performance of machine learning based high-performance computing applications running on these accelerators. The goal is to better understand how to integrate with existing and upcoming supercomputers at the facility to accelerate science insights.</p>
        
        <p><b>Activities:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a range of hardware and software environments for AI-accelerators</li>
          <li>Provide a platform to benchmark applications, programming models and ML frameworks</li>
          <li>Support science application teams to port and evaluate their applications</li>
          <li>Co-ordinate with vendors with product developments</li>
        </ul>
        
        Currently, the AI-Testbed has Cerebras, SambaNova and GraphCore systems set up and running. We are working closely with vendors including Groq, among others.</div>
